    <p>Or, actually:</p>
<h1>Semantic Web Crash &amp; Burn</h1>
<p>I sent a <a href="/2009/07/10/semantic-web.html">very naïve open letter</a> to a few key players in the semweb space a few years ago. I got no responses, and hence thought that either my question was posed incorrectly, or the field is so new no-one can really answer me, or the race is on to lay the groundwork and therefore there’s no time to get a newbie up to speed, or X. (I don’t know what X is yet.)</p>
<p>Fast-forward 3 years and I now have a project going which may or may not generate some valuable data soon. I want to store the data in a way that makes sense for humans and computers alike. I do not want to index everything, because being presented with a list of 10 close matches to what you want is so archaic. And since I’m a big fan of free PaaS hosting plans, the data needs to be stored very efficiently, and I should be able to operate on it every efficiently. Besides, <a href="http://www.information-management.com/blogs/big-data-size-mass-velocity-10022886-1.html">your Big Data is big enough</a>, so I should be OK.</p>
<p>Without further ado, I’ve dedicated my evening to a Deep Dive of everything semweb.</p>
<p>I love the web and I’m a web programmer. I also want to give meaning to my data, i.e. attach some sort of semantics. Roll on.</p>
<h1>Overview</h1>
<p>I started this post at 7 and now it’s 11. I got stuck on a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linked_data">handful of Wikipedia articles</a> and <a href="http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/">W3C</a> recommendations and working groups. It all reminded me of this XKCD on standards:</p>
<p><a href="http://xkcd.com/927/"><img alt="XKCD #927 (http://xkcd.com/927/)" src="http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/standards.png" width="500" height="283"></a></p>
<p>After hours of randomly clicking and reading bits and pieces, I’ve managed to get a better overview of the state of semweb.</p>
<h1>And then a funny thing happened</h1>
<p>This is where I was supposed to write about it all, dissect it, make sense of it and summarise it.</p>
<p>I was going to give you a primer on simple terms like taxonomy, vocabulary and ontology. I was going to tell you how we’re still far away from data and still very much document-based, stuck in silos, and how traditional markup doesn’t cut it—how it does not describe what something means, how <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microformat">microformats</a> is a web-based approach to semantic markup, and how this proliferation of formats can luckily be ground down into something coherent using <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GRDDL">GRDDL</a>. Most importantly, I was going to tell you about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge_representation_and_reasoning">knowledge representation</a> using OWL and RDF, and the software tools to peruse said formats.</p>
<p>Then I realised: my brain is so crammed with 4 hours worth of reading all this stuff, that I need to find a way to do exactly that: <strong>a knowledge representation of what’s in my brain</strong>.</p>
<p>Then something in my head went <em>snap</em>.</p>
<p>I ended up on the floor in a spasmodic fit of hilarity, sucking my thumb. The confusion punctured my prefrontal cortex, and I now only speak to uppity wooden chairs. In reverse. My brain turned on itself in the most meta way possible. I had to stop.</p>
<h1>Conclusion</h1>
<p>I don’t want to duplicate any knowledge here, so there will be no summaries. But, I’ve seen the suffering, and will leave with you the following tips:</p>
<ul>
<li>if you ever publish anything, and it’s not data, please <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embedded_RDF">annotate</a> it for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence">generations to come</a>. The web is too noisy to scrape anything anymore and we’re too busy to build a spider to make sense of your mash of markup.</li>
<li>there are <a href="http://answers.semanticweb.com/">places</a> where you can ask questions if you get stuck.</li>
<li>don’t silo your data or think it belongs to you especially if your users created it (here’s looking at you, Facebook). <a href="http://vibrantdata.org/">It should be free.</a></li>
<li>don’t break the web by creating user profiles and not annotating it with <a href="http://microformats.org/wiki/hcard">hCard</a> at the very least. There’s also <a href="http://www.foaf-project.org/">FOAF</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XHTML_Friends_Network">XFN</a>.</li>
<li>don’t expect silver bullets. There are smart people doing good things to take this movement forward, like <a href="http://www.opencalais.com/">http://www.opencalais.com/</a> (even though OC are too focused on companies/mergers news)</li>
<li>there’s too much standards documentation for me to consume right now. <a href="http://hueniverse.com/2012/07/oauth-2-0-and-the-road-to-hell/">Process can scare the most optimistic of us away</a>, but it seemed the folks at W3C managed to pull something wonderful together. I really do hope I can get through it all one day.</li>
<li>a few weeks after doing this 7-11 stint, I found a semweb on-line test, and memory served me well. I’ll consume you yet, semweb, just you wait.</li>

<p>…other things I wanted to write a few words about, but responsibilities beckon.</p>
<h2>LOD</h2>
<p>This really excites me: http://www.w3.org/wiki/SweoIG/TaskForces/CommunityProjects/LinkingOpenData</p>
<p>See FAQ #7: “Invent heuristics to auto-generate links between data items from different sources.”</p>
<p>And then further down there is a list of passionate people telling the world how they could help.</p>
