    <p>Often I'd like to start a new project, but shaving-the-yak quickly kicks in, and I start doing things like:</p>
<h1>Writing all the software from scratch</h1>
<p>I'd like to start a web comic, but it has to be self-hosted, because:</p>
<ul>
<li>I'm an indie-webber</li>
<li>I don't want to pay for a hosted solution</li>
<li>Something exists, but it doesn't have quite all the features I want</li>
</ul>
<p>I then also think things like <em>"Ah, this is the opportune moment to learn language X, so I'll start re-inventing Wheel badly in that"</em>.</p>
<p>Nothing ends up getting done, because <em>Wheel</em> takes the back-seat after a while, especially when that Other creative impulse comes creeping back.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Put the pen down. Look for that hosted solution. Do an MVP. Remember that you wanted to release a web comic, not web comic software.</p>
</blockquote>
<h1>I learn something on the job</h1>
<p>...but have to write a blog post about the thing I learnt first. Like this post.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It's good to make a note of those moments of clarity, but do it quickly and move on quickly.</p>
</blockquote>
<h1>My creative rhythm isn't compatible with the life I chose</h1>
<p>You do your best work when</p>
<ul>
<li>the sun is down</li>
<li>it is 5AM</li>
<li>you've had the opportunity to wake up slowly over the course of 2 hours, and is finally in the zone</li>
</ul>
<p>Well, you can't anymore.</p>
<p>If you go to bed too late, you'll have to wake up with the family early the next morning anyway. Children need feeding and getting dressed, and you can't be a groggy arse around them.</p>
<p>Creating things in the evening might encroach on you and your spouse's together-time, because he/she mightn't have the same rhythm as you do.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Either learn to force yourself to work on someone else's schedule, or choose a life which suits you.</p>
