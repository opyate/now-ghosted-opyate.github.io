    <p>Let's make this a quick one. I'm a busy dad, you know.</p>
<p>First of all, nothing come close to the friendship I've developed with my wee
little girl this year. She's two and a half now, and becoming ever more switched
on. She embraced the recent house move admirably. She also has a sneaky sense of
humour, and will make a great fighter one day. (Coming from a civilised man,
this means intellectual fighting, like the ones you encounter in a court room. Naturally.)</p>
<p>Did I mention a new house? Yes, I did. It's great. Right next to an Ofsted
outstanding (for 20 years running) school. And a park in the back. This means
no-one overlooks us. Which is great. I'm earmarking the garage as a dual study
slash workshop. Stay tuned.</p>
<p>A quick word on tech. I've mostly been at Conde Nast this year, heading up the
API team. Our remit is ever expanding, so soon we'll re-incorporate to something
more "platform team" -like. My immediate team uses JavaScript, but we'll be
doing more Clojure/ClojureScript soon, and have been getting our hands dirty
with a lot of ops involving Kubernetes, Docker, etc.</p>
<p>Personally, I've been doing a lot of stuff in Racket this year. Mostly personal
projects still under wraps.</p>
<p>OK, so my wife is calling me from upstairs now. Talking of which. She is great.
This blog post is dedicated to her. You are a strong, beautiful woman in the
face of all the hiccups you've encountered through-out your life (including
me!). I love you.</p>
