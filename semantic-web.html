    <p>Hi there,</p>
<p>I'm Juan and I'm new to SW.</p>
<p>I eagerly jumped into the deep end of the SW pool and wanted to create a "lists on the web" program, but 30 minutes into the whole ordeal I realised that</p>
<ul>
<li>it's going to be a gross duplication of (possibly existing) data.</li>
<li>there's already a slew of tools I can utilise and improve.</li>
<li>I'm very naive, and this Semantic Web thing is a beast ;-)</li>
</ul>
<p>Here's a post I left on the SW London Meetup.com group message board, to give you an idea of what I planned.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I'm going to run an idea by you and would like some input as to its feasibility/usefulness.</p>
<p>In an attempt to learn Scala I want to do a fun SW project. My inspiration is the Cloud, Lisp's concept of lists, and my mate's listing of DVD titles on some crummy web site. I wanted to create a web site that isn't limited to just DVD titles. You could, for instance, have a list of favourite sci-fi novels (and have an ISBN plugin on top of it to add value) or have a list of friends (and have a FaceBook plugin... etc).</p>
<p>So, I guess, instead of having said plugins, you create RDF for your data:</p>
<p><pre>
my book has the identifier #isbn
with:
        subject = my book
        predicate = has the identifier
        object = some ISBN number
</pre></p>
<p>The upper ontology can be "everything" (i.e. the root of all your lists), then you can start breaking it down: people (and in turn family and friends), books (and in turn novels, novellas, prose) etc.</p>
<p>This data, and the meta data that describes it can now obviously be used by other services: Amazon can send you recommendations based on your books list. Some chef can send you recipes based on your favourite recipes list. Etc.</p>
<p>And it's all hosted in the cloud, or on your personal site, or on a site I'm going to create for this purpose (domain already purchased: listabl.es). I hope to develop a re-usable piece of free Open Source software which anybody can host anywhere, then the various instances can "talk" and/or provide a useful API to the outside world.</p>
<p>The main pull for this idea in a social sense is that people like to make lists of their favourite things and share it.</p>
<p>This message is by no means complete, but I'd like to discuss the idea further at the next meetup.</p>
<p>Juan</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And the initial github commit: <a href="http://listabl.es">listabl.es</a></p>
<p>Since I've created this github project, I've started researching this weird and wonderful subject and came across things like FOAF, SKOS, etc. Presumably there's a namespace somewhere in there which can be re-used to link individuals with their "lists of things".</p>
<p>Said "things" also shouldn't need to be duplicated if they exist already. E.g. one of my favourite authors is already defined here: <a href="http://dbpedia.org/page/Greg_Egan">Greg Egan on dbpedia.org</a> and surely my FOAF profile can somehow define a "list of my favourite authors" which in turn points to this resource.</p>
<p>Anyhoo, as you can see I'm keen to learn and keen to invest my time in SW. I'm very eager to work on something worthwhile, so please let me know where I can direct my attention to - perhaps an Open Source project? I'm a coder - not an editor/writer, but if you need me on documentation duty, I'll gladly oblige.</p>
<p>Thanks for reading, and please leave a comment below, or <a href="mailto:%6F%70%79%61%74%65%40%67%6D%61%69%6C%2E%63%6F%6D">contact me</a>.</p>
